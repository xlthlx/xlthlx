# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Serena.

My job is Senior Developer, and I have over 20 years of experience in the digital and IT industry.

I started in 1998 by creating HTML pages and taking an ASP 3.0 course.
In 1999, I completed my first website based on ASP 3.0, Access and HTML, and then worked as a Webmaster for some web agencies.
In 2007, I did my first PHP project; in 2008, I built a business website based on WordPress.

I work mainly with WordPress; my primary skills are PHP, Databases, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Because I love WordPress and Open Source, I developed three WordPress plugins, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-inci/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WP INCI</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Site Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/comments-subscriber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comments Subscriber</a>. I also made a speech at WordCamp Milan 2019 about <a href="https://milano.wordcamp.org/2019/session/sviluppare-temi-con-timber-e-twig/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to develop themes with Timber and Twig </a>(Italian) and one at WordCamp Verona 2023 about <a href="https://verona.wordcamp.org/2023/session/block-editor-tricks-for-lazy-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Block Editor tricks for lazy people</a>.
